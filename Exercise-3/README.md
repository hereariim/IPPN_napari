# Integrating a python script into the plugin

## Python script

The script is contained in the `seuillage.py`

## Integration

I- Integrate the script into `_widget.py`

1- We're going to create a function to contain the script

```
def threshold_f(current_image):
    ###
    SCRIPT
    ###
    return mask
```

*See correction:*

2- Putting a decorator above the function

We're going to create a user interface to handle the script input

```
@magicgui(call)
def threshold_f(current_image):
    ###
    SCRIPT
    ###
    return mask
```

*See correction:*
