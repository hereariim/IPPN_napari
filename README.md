# IPPN : Napari as a tool for phenotyping

![Alt text](images-credit/logos.png)

This document is part of the Hands on session of the IPPN 2023. The aim of this document is to show the value of napari in plant phenotyping.

It is not intended to be a training session. That would require a lot of time to fully explore napari. The Hands on session for napari is a three-part discovery activity:
- Introducing the napari visualisation tools
- Getting started a napari plugin
- Getting started the design and development of a plugin
